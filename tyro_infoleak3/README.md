This challenge can't be done by hand like the previous two because it requires math and has a very strict time limit. I spent a lot of time making a fast and reliable solution to reading 4 bytes. You can see it in the Python code.

You need to read the same things you do in the same, but spread it across multiple connections. Remember that there's no penalty to solving a problem over 5000 connections instead of 1.
